# road_designer
A clothoid based road creator which I believe can be used inside a game to build roads and bridges.

I am a Linux user and I have attempted on a few occassions to compile this for Linux but I always seem to miss an edit some place.
I have uploaded the raw unedited files in their original states.
In the coming days I will, as my schedule allows once agin begin to edit these files in anattempt to get them in a neutral format.
But, since I am the parent of a freshman I find myself once again studying Algebra and World History and this does take up much of my spare time.
My over all goal is to use this in a strategy game and to be honest I am not sure if it need to be designed as a mudule or a addon.
